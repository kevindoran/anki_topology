                "\n<h3>Reasoning steps</h3>\n<p>The though chain in full.</p>\n<h4>1. Define bounded</h4>\n<p>For the single dimension case, the following are equivalent statements \nregarding a function \\( f : X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\\( f \\) is bounded.</li>\n<li>\\( fX \\) is bounded.</li>\n<li>There exists an \\( M \\ge 0 \\) such that for all \\( y \\in fX \\), \\( |y| \\le M \\).</li>\n<li>There exists an \\( M \\ge 0 \\) such that for all \\( x \\in X \\), \\( |f(x)| \\le\nM \\).</li>\n<li>As \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is a metric space, we can phrase #3 with ε-balls: there is an \\( B(0, M) \\) for some \\( M \\ge 0 \\) such that \\( fX \\subseteq B(0, M) \\).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#4 Generalizes the question to functions whose co-domain is metric \n(\\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\)).</p>\n<h4>2. Functions with finite domain are bounded</h4>\n<p>If \\( X \\) is finite, then any function \\( f : X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\)\n(continuous or not) is bounded, since we can take \\( M = max_{x \\in X}|f(x)| \\).\n<em>max</em> over a finite set of real numbers is a real number.</p>\n<h4>3. \\( X \\) covered by finite bounded subsets</h4>\n<p>If the domain \\( X \\) can be expressed as a finite union of subsets \n\\( (A_j)_{j \\in J} \\) such that a function \\( f : X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is \nbounded on each individual \\( A_j \\), then \\( f \\) itself must be bounded.\nWhy? Well, we can choose for each \\( j \\in J \\) some \\( M_j \\ge 0 \\) such that\nfor all \\( x \\in A_j, |f(x)| \\le M_j \\). Then the maximum of these, \\( M = max_{j \\in J} M_j \\) bounds the whole of \\( fX \\).</p>\n<p>Now the question becomes, given a set \\( X \\), how can we express it as \na union of bounded sets.</p>\n<h4>4. Locally bounded near every \\( x \\in X \\)</h4>\n<p>A continuous function need not be bounded, but it is 'locally bounded' in \nthe following sense.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Metric space, \\( X \\)</dt>\n<dd>Let \\( x \\in X \\). There is some \\( \\delta_x &gt; 0 \\) such that \n\\( B(x, \\delta_x ) \\) is a subset of&nbsp; \\( f^{-1}(f(x) - 1, f(x) + 1) \\), the latter being an open neighbourhood of \\( x \\).</dd>\n<dt>The same idea for a topological space, \\( X \\), and function \\( f : X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\)</dt>\n<dd>Let \\( x \\in X \\). The set \\( U_x = f^{-1}(f(x) -1, f(x) + 1) \\) is an\nopen neighbourhood of \\( x \\) and satisfies \\( fU_x \\subseteq (f(x) - 1, f(x)\n+ 1) \\).</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In both of these cases, \\( f \\) is bounded by \\( f(x) + 1 \\) when restricted\nto \\( B(x, \\delta_x) \\) and \\( U_x \\) respectively. So each \\( x \\in X \\) has\na neighbourhood on which \\( f \\) is bounded.</p>\n<p>Trying to utilize this idea to cover \\( X \\) with bounded subsets runs up \nagainst issues of infinite sets.</p>\n<h4>5. The maximum of an infinite set</h4>\n<p>We know that for each \\( x \\in X \\), there is a neighbourhood \\( U_x \\) on \nwhich the continuous function \\( f \\) is bounded, with \\( |f(u)| \\le M_x \\) for \nall \\( u \\in U_x \\). The subsets \\( (U_x)_{x \\in X} \\) cover \\( X \\), so why not \nuse \\( M = max_{x \\in X}M_x \\) as the bounds for \\( f \\)? The trouble is, this\nmaximum might not be a well-defined real number, since \\( X \\) is infinite.</p>\n<h4>6. Impose a finite cover requirement</h4>\n<p>Presuppose that it was possible to cover \\( X \\) with only \n<em>finitely many</em> of the sets \\( U_x \\). If \\( Z \\subseteq X \\) was a \nfinite set such that the neighbourhoods \\( (U_x)_{x \\in Z} \\) covered \\( X \\), \nthen we could legitimately set \\( M = max_{z \\in Z} M_z \\).</p>\n<p>So, in order to be able to assert that all continuous maps \n\\( X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) be continuous, we have needed to assume that there is\na finite set of open subsets that cover \\( X \\).

                "<h4>1. A subspace of a compact space</h4>\n<p>A subspace of a compact space need not be compact. For example, \\( [0, 1] \\)\nis compact, yet \\( (0, 1) \\subseteq [0, 1] \\) is not compact. To see this, \nconsider the open cover of \\( (0, 1) \\) given by \n\\( ((\\varepsilon, 1)_{\\varepsilon &gt; 0}) \\). This cover has no finite subcover.\nThis example highlights that <em>all</em> open covers must have a subcover, \nand thus, to prove a space to be compact, it is not sufficient to find a single\nopen cover having a finite subcover—we must show that it is impossible for any\nopen cover to not have a finite subcover.\n</p>\n<h4>2. Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.</h4>\n<p>Proof outline. Any cover of a closed subset \\( V \\) can be appended by the \nsingle open set \\( X \\setminus V \\). This new set of subsets must cover \\( X \\),\nand must be finite as \\( X \\) is compact.</p>\n<p>Proof. Let \\( X \\) be a compact space and \\( V \\) a closed subset. Let \n\\( (U_i)_{i \\in I} \\) be a cover of \\( V \\) by open subsets of \\( X \\). Then\n\\( (U_i)_{i \\in I} \\) together with \\( X \\setminus V \\) is an open cover of \n\\( X \\).

This is for convenience, and is justified by the \nmodified formulation of cover for subsets. See Leinster's notes and Lemma B1.7.\n</p>\n<p>The converse is not necessarily true. Which is the topic of the next section.\n</p>\n<p>An idea that appeals to intuition regarding closed vs. open subsets and being compact: closed sets place more stringent requirements on any collection in order for the collection to be a cover. Consequently, some covers that might not have a finite subcover don't count as covers. This conceptualization might help motivate why closed subsets of a compact space are compact, and open subsets are not necessarily.</p>\n<h4>3. Not all compact subspaces of a compact space is closed.</h4>\n<p>\nTrivial counter-examples make this statement false. For example, \nconsider an indiscrete space on a set \\( X \\) that has two or more elements. All \nindiscrete spaces are compact. Now choose a proper subset \\( Y \\subset X \\) and\nconsider the subspace topology on \\( Y \\): the subspace topology on \\( Y \\) is\nindiscrete also (just \\( \\{Y, \\emptyset \\} \\)), so \\( Y \\) is compact. But \n\\( Y \\) is not closed in \\( X \\), as it is neither \\( \\emptyset \\) nor \\( X \\).\n</p>\n<p>What other examples are there of non-closed compact subspaces of a compact \nspace are there? Another example is the finite complement topology on \n\\( \\mathbb{R} \\). Every subspace of the finite complement topology on \n\\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is compact (try justify!). But the only proper subsets of \n\\( \\mathbb{R} \\) that are closed in this topology are the finite sets.</p>\n<p>With a pretty minimal extra restriction on \\( X \\) (being \nHausdorff), we can make the desired assertion.</p>\n<h4>Every compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed.</h4>\n<p>Note first that we have relaxed the requirement that the larger/outer space\nbe compact.</p>\n<p>Proof. Let \\( Y \\) be a compact  subspace of the Hausdorff space \\( X \\). We\nshall prove that \\( X - Y \\) is  open, so that \\( Y \\) must be closed.

The collection \\( \\{U_y : y \\in Y \\} \\) is a \ncovering of \\( Y \\) by sets open in \\( X \\). <em class=\"em2\">[This next bit is \nthe one and only point where we utilize the compactness of \\( Y \\).]</em>  There\nmust be a finite sub-cover, \\( U_Y = U_{y_1}, U_{y_2}, ..., U_{y_n} \\).

These slices are homeomorphic to one of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\),\n        so \\( f \\) must be constant alone both.

We can now state that \\( W \\in X \\setminus U \\), \nas \\( W \\subseteq X \\) and \\( W \\cap U = \\emptyset \\). As every element of \n\\( X \\setminus U \\) has a neighbourhood contained in \\( X \\setminus U \\), \n\\( X \\setminus U \\) must be open (again by A2.9).</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>So, we have both \\( U \\) and \\( X \\setminus U \\) being open. However, \\( X \\) is connected, so one of the sets must be empty\nand the other must equal \\( X \\). \\( x \\) itself is in \\( U \\), so \\( U = X \\).\n\\( U \\) is path-connected by definition, so \\( X \\) is path-connected.</p>\n<div><img src=\"IMG_2870.jpg\"></div>",
